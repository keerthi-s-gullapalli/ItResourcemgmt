ItResourceManagement
A web-based asset management system built for my school’s IT department to replace inefficient Excel tracking. Users can add, update, and filter devices with fields like asset ID, category, purchase info, and assigned staff. Built with Java, JSP, and MySQL for secure, dynamic, multi-user access.
